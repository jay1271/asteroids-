# asteroids-
a game development project
this is a project to remake a very old arcade but the challenge was that it needs to be done only programatically. 
if you are using this repository or the files, keep one or two things in mind the score functionality is in the game but you have to work on the canvas yourself
if you dont know how to do it use "Object.ToString" to link it to your canvas.
